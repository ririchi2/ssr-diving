# Server-Side Rendering Deep Dive

Welcome to the Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Deep Dive project! In this project, we will embark on a journey to uncover the inner workings of SSR frameworks like Next.js, Remix, and others. These frameworks, although complex on the surface, are built on a fundamentally straightforward concept. Our goal is to peel back the layers of abstraction and gain a deeper understanding of how SSR works under the hood.
